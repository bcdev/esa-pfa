High Priority:

* Multi-app webservice
* Query-patch selection tool (enabled when classifier is active) **done**
* Create mapping from path product ID to some public server from which users can download the actual product
    - Download product needs to get the base URL from descriptor file
* Make sure local and remote FEX versions are same
* User selection of application doesn't make sense

* PFA Preferences tab
    - Download Source URL - default from descriptor
    - Custom cmd - eg wget
    - Local search paths
    
Medium Priority:

* Store QL and feature information on server (use: metadata, tracability, documentation)
* Create classifier and save at the time the user creates it
